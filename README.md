# Snake
A classic old game!

However, the code is really a pile of shit. You'd better not attempt to modify it.

Notice that you should use ↑↓←→ to control its direction, and space for pause, enter for continue. No exit mode. Ahhh, there is also a function that you can use CTRL to speed up, but you'll lose some score though.
